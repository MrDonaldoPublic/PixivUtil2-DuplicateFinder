# PixivUtil2-DuplicateFinder

Finds duplicate files downloaded by [app](https://github.com/Nandaka/PixivUtil2) with default properties.

Files should be in folders like "<name>(user id)".

## How it works

Gathers all files in derived directory and merges all files with same author into latest folder.
